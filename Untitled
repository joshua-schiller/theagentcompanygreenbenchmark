3. **Very detailed explanations** - explaining every little thing
4. **Professional marketing tone** - "This is a high-performance..."
5. **References to non-existent files** - like FILE_REFERENCE.md mentioning QUESTION_RESPONSES.md
6. **Too many code examples** - every concept illustrated with code
7. **Perfect grammar and structure** - no typos, no casual language
8. **Comprehensive coverage** - explaining things that don't need explanation
